# Stocks
C# WPF Stocks Application

Every two hours a script file downloads historical stock information from the Yahoo! Finance API. This information includes, 
but is not limited to, closing values, high values, low values, volume, etc. This information is then displayed in the form of
a graph with dynamic axes. The axes change based on the range of information given to the graph. The graph is coded as a 
custom usercontrol. The graph can also display calculated lines, which are used to determine if the stock will grow or fall
based on certain algorithms found online.

One such algorithm is at: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud&gclid=CJWvqI_G0soCFUWUfgodUR4Otg

This project is also an experiment to see if these algorithms actually work, and if they work, how often they work.
